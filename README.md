# Machine Learning
A collection of AI/ML projects.

## Project I: House Prices
Created a very simple model that will predict a new house price based on previous data. (Supervised Learning)

## Project II: Georgia House Prices
Used Zillow house pricing datasets based on 1-4 bedrooms to create a model that would predict the price of a house with 5 or more bedrooms. 

## Project III: Wine Quality Prediction
Built a multiple linear regression model to predict the quality of red wine based on 11 features. Transformed and split the data using Yeo-Johnson and sklearn. Evaluated model accuracy using Root Mean Squared Error and Variance. 

## Project IV: MNIST KNN Classification Model
Built a K-Nearest Neighbors classification model to predict digit images from the MNIST_784 dataset. Split the dataset into training and testing sets, and created a function to plot the images. Tuned the hyperparameters of the model to increase accuracy through a grid search.
